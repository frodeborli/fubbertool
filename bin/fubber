# This dispatcher currently delegates all commands to fubber-php.
# In the future, it will detect the project language and delegate to:
#   - fubber-php for PHP projects
#   - fubber-python for Python projects
#   - fubber-js for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
#   - etc.

# Find the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# For now, just delegate to fubber-php
exec "${SCRIPT_DIR}/fubber-php" "$@"
